Imagine a box. It represents your mental model of the world. Your world view. Your reality. All your memories, knowledge and everything you can imagine. You can only think inside your personal box.

Outside of the box is everything that's not part of your mental model. Things you don't understand and cannot even imagine. Your unknown unkowns. The taste of food you never tried. The places you haven't been and which you don't even know exist.

You can't think outside your box. 

The box is a model, a compressed, reduced representation of all your past perceptions combined. You need it to predict the future. When you perceive something that didn't surprise you, it was part of your model. Your model was able to correctly predict the situation. So you can focus on other things.

But if your senses perceive something that surprises you, your learn. Your model tries to find a pattern to improve itself to produce better predictions for similar situations.

Your box has a characteristic shape. It is a map of the areas of knowledge you have. In areas where you are specialized, it is more dense, more detailed. In other areas it is vague and fuzzy.

Learning changes the shape of your box. It can make it grow and fill holes.

If someone is saying you're thinking out of the box, you're just thinking outside of their box. Because your box is bigger in that specific area. There is no out of the box thinking. There is just a bigger box.
